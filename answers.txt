Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Version control is an extremely important concept in not only team developing situations but also in
personal management. In my own experience (using Github Desktop) it has allowed me to streamline multiple projects
at the same time and handle their version controls and when I wanted to push or pull certain items.
