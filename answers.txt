Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: No joke, all of them. Personally I developed an ising model simuation and using pandas and mathplotlib, I
was able to ease parameterization, make a visualizer for myself, as well as monitor speedups on a thousand to million
simulation situation.
